This is my git cheat sheet. #Keepitasecret

## git commands

```bash
git init REPO-NAME
```
	- This will create repository called REPO-NAME
	
```bash
git status
```
- shows the status of the git repository

```bash
git show
``
- shows the commit history and changes

```bash
git add FILENAME ANOTHERFILENAME
```
- adds the files FILENAME and ANOTHERFILENAME to the stash

```bash
git commit -m "MESSAGE"
```
- commits the stashed files to the repo, and adds
the MESSAGE that describes what was done 


## Other GIT Things

**.gitignore** is a file that tells git files/folders that are
not to the part of the repository (that is - ignored when adding/committing)
